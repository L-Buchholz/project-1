# uProjekt Project Calendar (Project 1)

## Project Description

Programmers require a responsive online planner for scheduling timeframes to complete their projects: uProjekt. The planner will be allocated based on a project's deadline, with "Typical", "Accelerated", and "Custom" options available. Currently these features are in a placeholder stage.

In order to showcase the functionality of the project planner, the right side of the uProjekt home page has a demo calendar (featuring the current week and any associated US national holidays through a third-party API) with interactive task entry panels. The left side of the home page hosts a connected interactive task bar where tasks can be assigned to different categories depending on whether they need to be completed, are pending, or are finished.

The nav bar features placeholder tabs where users can access and manage their projects and contact the uProjekt team. The sign-up tab at the top registers visitors by email address and verifies the validity of these addresses through a third-party API.

## User Story

```md
AS A programmer with upcoming projects
I WANT an online program to manage them based on the timeframe it will take to complete each component (planning, coding, etc.)
SO THAT I can deliver my finished projects on-time.
```

## API's

1. Validator.pizza -- This application verifies email addresses for user contact and accounts: https://www.validator.pizza/

2. Non-working days -- This application incorporates non-working days (weekends, holidays, etc.) into scheduling: https://isdayoff.ru/ (NOTE: There is an English translation that we plan to use; otherwise we'll find a similar app)
